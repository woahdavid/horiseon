Refactoring code for a website to make it more accessibility friendly and further optimized for search engines. 
Editing semantic tags 
Ensuring title is descriptive and easy to understand
Adding "alt" for images for users that may be blind or have sight issues
Assurance that all links are indeed suitable for navigation

Code Organization
Div tags were changed to both main and section in the appropriate areas of the code
Semantic tags in CSS code were also changed to main
All images had "alt" added to them to ensure that there were descriptions available in the source code.
One link did not have the proper class, but was fixed and tested to ensure it is now serviceable
